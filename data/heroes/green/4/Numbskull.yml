    Damage over time on special: When this character casts their Special Skill, they give a Hunter's Mark on a random enemy. The target receives 150 damage over 3 turns. If a target already has this effect, the duration will be refreshed and the damage will be increased by 150, up to 1500 damage in total.

    Hunter`s sense: When this character casts their Special Skill, they transfer the newest cleansable status ailment from themself to the target. If the Special Skill cannot target an enemy, a random enemy is chosen instead. If this character has no cleansable status ailment, they recover 8% health.
