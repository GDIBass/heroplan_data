    Damage over time on special. When this character casts their Special Skill, 
    they give a Hunter's Mark on a random enemy. The target receives 150 damage 
    over 3 turns. If a target already has this effect, the duration will be
    refreshed and the damage will be increased by 150, up to 1500 damage in total.
  - >-
    Hunter's sense. When this character casts their Special Skill, they transfer
    the newest cleansable status ailment from themself to the target. If the 
    Special Skill cannot target an enemy, a random enemy is chosen instead. If
    this character has no cleansable status ailment, they recover 8% health.
